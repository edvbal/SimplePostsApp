Architecture: MVP

Language: Kotlin

I have focused on architecture side and unit testing because I think that they are essential for every app. Transitions and other UI tweaks could be done with more time in hand. 

To note: 
I have used MVP just because I have most experience with it. However, I would be more than happy to learn MVI or any other architecture. I love learning new things and I think I pick them up pretty fast. 

Also I have used two Activities with Fragments. I don't think that's ideal, if I did it again I would probably change it to single Activity and 2 fragments or Activity and Views.
